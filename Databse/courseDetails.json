      "pdf": "Data Science includes various fields such as mathematics, business insight, tools, processes and machine learning techniques. A mix of all these fields help us in discovering the visions or designs from raw data which can be of major use in the formation of big business decisions. As a Data scientist it’s your role to inspect which questions want answering and where to find the related data. A data scientist should have business insight and analytical services. One also needs to have the skill to mine, clean, and present data. Businesses use data scientists to source, manage, and analyze large amounts of unstructured data.R is a commanding language used extensively for data analysis and statistical calculating. It was developed in early 90s. R is an open-source software. R is unrestricted and flexible because it’s an open-source software. R’s open lines permit it to incorporate with other applications and systems. Open-source soft wares have a high standard of quality, since multiple people use and iterate on them. As a programming language, R delivers objects, operators and functions that allow employers to discover, model and envision data. Data science with R has got a lot of possibilities in the commercial world. Open R is the most widely used open-source language in analytics. From minor to big initiatives, every other company is preferring R over the other languages. There is a constant need for professionals with having knowledge in data science using R programming."

Before starting the course, you should have basic Python knowledge. Our aim in this course is to turn real-life problems into projects and then solve them using latest versions of artificial intelligence algorithms (machine learning algortihms and deep learning algorithms) and Python.We will carry out some of our projects using machine learning and some using deep learning algorithms. In this way, you will have a general perspective on artificial intelligence. When you complete the projects in our course, you will get a clear understanding of the basic working principles of Machine Learning software and Deep Learning algorithms and the difference between them.In our course, we will use well known datasets that are widely used by high level education about Machine Learning as well as custom datasets. By doing our projects, you will master artificial intelligence concepts as well as learn these famous datasets. After completing the course, you will be able to easily produce solutions to the problems that you may encounter in real life."

Pandas is a powerhouse tool that allows you to do anything and everything with colossal data sets -- analyzing, organizing, sorting, filtering, pivoting, aggregating, munging, cleaning, calculating, and more! I call it Excel on steroids!     Over the course of more than 19 hours, I'll take you step-by-step through Pandas, from installation to visualization! We'll cover hundreds of different methods, attributes, features, and functionalities packed away inside this awesome library. We'll dive into tons of different datasets, short and long, broken and pristine, to demonstrate the incredible versatility and efficiency of this package.Data Analysis with Pandas and Python is bundled with dozens of datasets for you to use. Dive right in and follow along with my lessons to see how easy it is to get started with pandas! Whether you're a new data analyst or have spent years (*cough* too long *cough*) in Excel,Data Analysis with pandas and Python offers you an incredible introduction to one of the most powerful data toolkits available today!"
